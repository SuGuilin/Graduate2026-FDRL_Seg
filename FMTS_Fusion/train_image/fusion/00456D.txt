A man walks down a brick-paved street, passing a white van and truck. Bicycles are parked near a small tree on a green grassy area. A black silhouette stands on the street, and a black and white image of a person is visible in front of a building. Temperature variations highlight the man and the white van, contrasting with the cooler surroundings.
