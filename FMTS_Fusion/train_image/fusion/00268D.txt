A red gate with a white roof stands beside a building with black shingles. A rail runs along the side, near a blue garbage can and a storm drain. A yellow line marks the road. Two figures are present: one on the street, another on a balcony. Heat signatures highlight the figures and the road, with the building showing cooler temperatures.
