A man in a black shirt rides a bike down a street, passing a brick building and a metal fence. Another person in a black jacket stands nearby, while a third sits on a bench. Two black awnings cover buildings, and large trees with green leaves line the street. Temperature variations highlight the warm bodies and cool structures.
