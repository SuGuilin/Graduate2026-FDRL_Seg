A man walks down a brick sidewalk at night, holding a flashlight. A car is parked on the side, casting a faint glow. A bicycle rests on a rack, and a green jacket lies nearby. A white fence and a black box with a bicycle are visible. Heat signatures highlight the man and the car, adding contrast to the dark scene.
