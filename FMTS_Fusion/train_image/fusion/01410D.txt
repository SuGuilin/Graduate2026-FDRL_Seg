A brick building and a large tree dominate the left side of the scene. A red car and a white garage door are visible on the right. White lines mark the road, which is darker and cooler. A black metal fence and a tree on the sidewalk add texture. A person stands in front of a tree, and a car drives down the road at night, emitting heat.
