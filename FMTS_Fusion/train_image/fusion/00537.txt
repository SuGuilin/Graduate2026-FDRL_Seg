A man stands on a rain-soaked street at night, illuminated by the headlights of a moving car and a parked white car. A red umbrella and a red and white tent add color to the urban scene. Heat signatures highlight the man, the moving car, and the lamp posts, contrasting with the cooler, wet pavement and buildings.
