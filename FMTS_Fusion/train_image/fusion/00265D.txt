A large gate with a "Tokyo" sign is centered, surrounded by a fence. A person in a black shirt walks on the sidewalk, while another stands nearby. The street, marked with white letters and a yellow line, leads to a red and brown building. A man in a white shirt stands out in the cool night, with a bridge over calm waters in the distance.
