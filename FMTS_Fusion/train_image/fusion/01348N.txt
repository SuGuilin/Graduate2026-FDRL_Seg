A man walks down a dark street, with a parked blue car and a distinct white line visible on the road. Two people in black jackets walk on the sidewalk. A green tunnel with a light shining on it and a green stick in mid-air add to the scene. Heat signatures highlight the man and the people on the sidewalk, emphasizing their presence in the cool night.
