A woman in a white coat stands on a dark street, near a red and white sign and an orange and gray trash can. A white-painted crosswalk leads to an orange and white water hydrant. A white building with many windows and green bushes line the street. A tree with green leaves frames the scene. Heat signatures highlight the woman and the hydrant.
