A white car and a red bus drive down a rain-soaked city street at night, their headlights illuminating the wet pavement. A man stands beside a parked truck. The city skyline looms in the background, with buildings faintly visible. Heat signatures highlight the vehicles and the man, contrasting with the cooler environment.
