A city street at night features a white line on the road, a white car, a white truck, and several other white vehicles parked along the street. A person is crossing the street, and another stands nearby. Buildings, including one with stone pillars and another with a balcony, line the street. Heat signatures highlight the people and vehicles, distinguishing them from the cooler surroundings.
