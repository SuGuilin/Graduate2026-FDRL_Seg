A man walks down a dark, asphalt street at night, visible on the sidewalk. A bicycle tire rests near the roadside. A green bush contrasts against a black background, while a long green stalk stands nearby. The road is largely empty, with a car driving ahead, its warm engine and lights standing out in the cool night.
