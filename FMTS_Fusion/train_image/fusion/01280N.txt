A man walks down a dimly lit street at night, carrying a blue backpack and a white bag. The asphalt road is illuminated by a distant light, with a building featuring a lit window on one side. A green leaf and a tall black tower with a green light top add texture. Thermal contrasts highlight the man and the warm areas, emphasizing his presence and the lit window.
