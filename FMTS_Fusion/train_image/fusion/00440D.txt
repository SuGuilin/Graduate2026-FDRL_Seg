A woman walks on a brick-paved sidewalk, passing a green and brown tree with leaves and a yellow object on a branch. A manhole cover is visible on the sidewalk. A black and gold box with a light stands nearby. Trees and a distant figure are highlighted against the cool night, with a building in the background.
