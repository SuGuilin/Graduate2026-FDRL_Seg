A beach scene with people walking and umbrellas dotting the shoreline. Two white umbrellas form a cozy spot, with a single one nearby. The sand is brown, and a gray sky looms overhead. A boardwalk runs parallel to the beach, and distant umbrellas are visible through the fog. Heat signatures highlight individuals and a white-hatted person.
