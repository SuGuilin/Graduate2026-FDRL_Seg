A quiet, curving street at night, with wet pavement reflecting minimal light. Trees line the right side, and a leafless bush is at the bottom. A white traffic sign and painted letters on the road are visible. Heat signatures highlight the presence of a person atop a hill and warmer areas on the wet road.
