A person walks down a dimly lit street at night, with another person visible on the sidewalk. The road is clear, marked by a white line, and a manhole cover is present. Buildings with lit windows stand in the background. Trees line the street, casting shadows. Heat signatures highlight the individuals, making them stand out against the cooler surroundings.
