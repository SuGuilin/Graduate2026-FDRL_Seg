A city street at night features a row of parked vehicles including white vans, a yellow box truck, and a car. Heat signatures highlight the warm engines of recently used vehicles, contrasting with the cool pavement and a dark, empty road. A person stands as a cool silhouette against a warmer wall, and a green bush with a flying object adds texture.
