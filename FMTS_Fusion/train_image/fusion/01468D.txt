A cobblestone street leads past a building on the left and a parked van on the right. A large tree provides shade, and a sign stands by the roadside. A person is visible near the van, and another walks in the distance. A metal box with a window adds to the urban landscape. Temperature variations highlight the warm van and the cooler tree.
