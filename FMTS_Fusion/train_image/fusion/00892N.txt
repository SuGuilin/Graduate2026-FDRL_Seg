A man and several others walk down a dimly lit street at night. Bicycles are parked on the sidewalk and roadside. A bus drives past, and a person rides a bike. Warm areas highlight individuals and vehicles, contrasting with cooler surroundings. A white railing and a sign on a pole add structure to the scene.
