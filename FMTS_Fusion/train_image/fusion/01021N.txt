A man walks down a dimly lit street, his figure blurred by movement. A car with all lights on is parked nearby. Bicycles are scattered on the sidewalk and roadside. Green leaves contrast against a dark background, while a black wall and trees add depth. Heat signatures highlight the man and car, emphasizing their presence in the cool night.
