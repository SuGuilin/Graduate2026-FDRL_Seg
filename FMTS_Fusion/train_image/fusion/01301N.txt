A nighttime street is illuminated by street lights, with buildings lining both sides. A person walks along the concrete sidewalk, and a car is parked on the road. Trees contrast against the dark sky, and various objects like trash cans and poles add texture. Heat signatures highlight the person and car, enhancing visibility.
