A person with a white umbrella stands on a wet city street, sheltered from the rain, near a pink and blue umbrella. Another individual in blue shorts holds an umbrella nearby. Tall buildings and trees line the street, with a bridge visible in the distance. Two people stand in front of a tree at night, and a man is visible in the shade.
