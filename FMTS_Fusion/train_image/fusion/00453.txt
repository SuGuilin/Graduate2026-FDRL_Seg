A car drives down a foggy city street at night, its headlights illuminating the wet asphalt. A parked car with lights on is visible in the darkness. A white pole stands by the roadside. Heat signatures highlight the cars and a person standing in the street, with the warmest areas contrasting against the cool, foggy environment.
