A person walks down a rain-soaked street at night, holding an umbrella. A bicycle rests on the sidewalk nearby. Warm lights from a distant building illuminate the scene, while a white line on the road and a dark, bird-like figure add contrast. A bench and a black hat with a white brim are faintly visible in the cool night air.
