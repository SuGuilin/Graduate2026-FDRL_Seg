A black and white street scene at night shows a car turning left, another driving straight, and a parked car. The road is gray, with a house and a tall telephone pole in the background. A man stands on the street, and a tree is visible. Heat signatures highlight the engines and exhausts of the moving cars, emphasizing their activity despite the low light.
