A dark grey concrete building illuminated by white lights stands beside a concrete sidewalk. A person holding an object is visible, walking near the building. A car drives on a dark road, and a metal box and a white and black object with a black background add to the monochromatic scene. Heat signatures highlight the person and car, emphasizing their presence in the night.
